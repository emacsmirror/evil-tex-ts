;; Tree-sitter based LaTeX text objects for Evil mode.
;; Requires Emacs 29.1+ with built-in tree-sitter support.

;; Text objects:
;;   ie/ae - LaTeX environment
;;   ic/ac - LaTeX command
;;   im/am - Math mode
;;   id/ad - Delimiters
;;
;; Toggles (mt prefix):
;;   mte - Toggle environment asterisk (equation <-> equation*)
;;   mtm - Toggle math mode (\(...\) <-> \[...\])
;;   mtd - Toggle delimiter sizing (() <-> \left(\right))
;;   mtc - Toggle command asterisk (\section <-> \section*)
